## <a name="value_a"></a>1. Default to Action

It's better to deliver something good today than to deliver something perfect tomorrow. We prioritize taking action right away when we see a problem and putting our work out there early and often, knowing that we will change regularly and will iterate to improve on it over time.

## <a name="value_b"></a>2. Ownership Mindset

Our mindset is grounded in doing work that resonates with the community, our team's goals and our individual interests. This drives us to roll up our sleeves and own every element of what we do. 

## <a name="value_c"></a>3. Curiosity

We believe in the value of asking the right questions, listening to new ideas, and gathering feedback from our teammates and our community, as their voices form the foundation of our work.

## <a name="value_d"></a>4. Share What You Learn

We believe in openly sharing what we learn with the XR industry in order to ground us in our work and keep us focused on what matters: helping our students succeed and building a larger and stronger ecosystem as a result.

## <a name="value_e"></a>5. Lead Through Data

When making decisions, we prioritize using data to support opinions. Data creates clarity and aligns our team to work on the things with the largest impact.

## <a name="value_f"></a>6. Grow Through Feedback

We believe that others have much to teach us and when we receive feedback, we take action to make improvements. We prioritize building a team that's highly talented, motivated, supportive and that always embraces opportunities for growth.
