## <a name="mission"></a>Mission

Our mission is to provide the immersive technology industry's best knowledge and resources for learning the skills to create XR applications.

## <a name="values"></a>Values

Circuit Stream's values are [Default to Action](#value_a), [Ownership Mindset](#value_b), [Curiosity](#value_c), [Share What You Learn](#value_d), [Lead through Data](#value_e) and [Be Open](#values_f).

## <a name="value_a"></a>1. Default to Action

We believe in taking action when we see a problem and that it's better to deliver something real today, over something that's maybe better later. Work that's shipped can and should always be improved upon, non existent work can't be adjusted at all.

## <a name="value_b"></a>2. Ownership Mindset

Our mindset is grounded in creating educational experiences that resonate with our community and our individual interests. This drives us to roll up our sleeves and own every element of our work.

## <a name="value_c"></a>3. Curiosity

We believe in asking the right questions, iterating on ideas, and gathering feedback from our teammates and community, as their voices form the foundation of our work.

## <a name="value_d"></a>4. Share What You Learn

We believe in opnely sharing what we learn with our community, partners and the external industry to ground our work and keep us focused on what matters: helping all professionals working in XR.

## <a name="value_e"></a>5. Lead through Data

We believe in moving beyond opinions and approaching decisions with data. Data creates clarity and aligns our team to work on the things with the largest impact.

## <a name="value_f"></a>6. Be Open

We believe building a company where everyone can exchange informartion and ideas openly is vital if we are going to impact a new generation of immersive technology.
