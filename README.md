## <a name="value_a"></a>1. Default to Action

It's better to deliver something real today, over something maybe better later. We prioritize execution, knowing that we can and will iterate to improve a solution over time, and when we see a problem, we take action whether it's our job or not.  

## <a name="value_b"></a>2. Ownership Mindset

Our mindset is grounded in creating educational experiences that resonate with our community and our individual interests. This drives us to roll up our sleeves and own every element of our work.

## <a name="value_c"></a>3. Curiosity

We believe in asking the right questions, iterating on ideas, and gathering feedback from our teammates and community, as their voices form the foundation of our work.

## <a name="value_d"></a>4. Share What You Learn

We believe in opnely sharing what we learn with our community, partners and the external industry to ground our work and keep us focused on what matters: helping all professionals working in XR.

## <a name="value_e"></a>5. Lead through Data

We believe in moving beyond opinions and approaching decisions with data. Data creates clarity and aligns our team to work on the things with the largest impact.

## <a name="value_f"></a>6. Be Open

We believe building a company where everyone can exchange informartion and ideas openly is vital if we are going to impact a new generation of immersive technology.
